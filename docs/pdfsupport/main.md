# Configuring PDF support

Note: Whether or not you'll be able to set this up, depends a lot on how much control you have over the webserver.

Currently, there are two built-in scenarios:

* [Using BrowserShot](browsershot.md): If you have full control over the webserver, you can set up BrowserShot. PDF generation happens on the web server.
* [Using an external PDF renderer](external.md): If you don't have full control over the web server, you can point to an external service to convert HTML to PDF.
