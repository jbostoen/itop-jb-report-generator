# Dashlet

If you'd like to show a report as a dashlet, it can be done using [Combodo's iFrame Dashlet](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/products/itop-iframe-dashlet) .

1. Just prepare the report.  
2. Grab the URL from the actual report after preparing the OQL filter (which you can simply do in the iTop user interface to make a selection of what you want).  
3. Configure the iFrame dashlet and paste the URL.
