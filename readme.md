Please get in touch to discuss the terms: **info@jeffreybostoen.be** / https://jeffreybostoen.be

## What?

Feature: report generator. Quickly add detailed reports to different classes (detail view and list view).  

‚ö† Needs some tweaking to make it work in other environments! 
The PDF export is unlikely to work on a typical web host provider; unless you have more control over the server as it depends on Puppeteer.

This extension is offered for free, pull requests are appreciated.  
Since many organizations require their own reports, there are no default reports included.  
Get in touch for support or to get some reports developed for your organization.
